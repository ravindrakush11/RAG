🔍 What is RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)?
RAG combines information retrieval and language generation:

First, it retrieves relevant documents from a large corpus based on a query.

Then, it augments the query with these documents and feeds them into a language model (like GPT, BERT, etc.) to generate a relevant and contextual response.

This approach is useful when you want your model to answer questions using up-to-date or external knowledge without retraining it.
