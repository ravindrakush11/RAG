## 🔍 What is RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)?

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a powerful technique that enhances language model responses by combining **information retrieval** with **text generation**.

### 🔧 How it works:

1. **Document Retrieval**  
   RAG first searches a large corpus to retrieve the most relevant documents based on the user's query.

2. **Query Augmentation & Generation**  
   These retrieved documents are then combined with the original query and passed to a language model (e.g., GPT, BERT) to generate a context-aware and accurate response.

### 🧠 Why use RAG?

- Allows models to answer questions using **external or real-time knowledge**
- **No need to retrain** the base language model on new data
- Ideal for **open-domain QA**, **document-based chatbots**, and **knowledge-based systems**

RAG enables smarter and more informed responses—perfect for scenarios where knowledge is vast, dynamic, or frequently updated.
