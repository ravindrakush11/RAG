## 🔍 What is RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)?

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a powerful technique that enhances language model responses by combining **information retrieval** with **text generation**.

### 🔧 How it works:

1. **Document Retrieval**  
   RAG first searches a large corpus to retrieve the most relevant documents based on the user's query.

2. **Query Augmentation & Generation**  
   These retrieved documents are then combined with the original query and passed to a language model (e.g., GPT, BERT) to generate a context-aware and accurate response.

### 🧠 Why use RAG?

- Allows models to answer questions using **external or real-time knowledge**
- **No need to retrain** the base language model on new data
- Ideal for **open-domain QA**, **document-based chatbots**, and **knowledge-based systems**

RAG enables smarter and more informed responses—perfect for scenarios where knowledge is vast, dynamic, or frequently updated.

Sure! Here's a GitHub-friendly `README.md` **Features** section formatted with markdown:

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Document Embedding & Vector Store Creation**  
  Automatically convert documents into embeddings and store them efficiently for retrieval.

- 📄 **Text Preprocessing Pipeline**  
  Clean, tokenize, and normalize text data before embedding for better results.

- 🧠 **Integration-Ready for LLM-Based Generation**  
  Easily connect with large language models (e.g., GPT, LLaMA) for generating contextual answers.

- 🛠️ **Postprocessing & Logging Utilities**  
  Tools to refine outputs and log results for debugging, evaluation, and monitoring.

- 🗂️ **Modular Design**  
  Swap or customize components like retrievers, embeddings, and models for rapid experimentation.

Absolutely! Here's the polished and properly formatted GitHub-style `README.md` section for **Project Structure**, **Installation**, **Usage**, and **Customization**:

## 📦 Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ravindrakush11/RAG.git
cd RAG
```

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🧪 Usage

To start the main RAG pipeline, run:

```bash
python app_st.py
```

> **Note:** Make sure your document corpus or input data is properly prepared and formatted before running the script.

---

## 🔧 Customization

- ✨**Embeddings**: Modify `embedding.py` to switch or fine-tune the embedding model.
- 🧹**Preprocessing**: Adjust `preprocessed.py` to add domain-specific cleaning or tokenization.
- 🧠**Post-processing**: Tweak `postprocessing.py` to improve the quality and relevance of generated answers.
- 💾**Vector Store**: Experiment with different vector storage options in `vector_store.py` (e.g., FAISS, Chroma, etc.).
